Here’s a run-down of useful commands for pip, virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper.

    mkvirtualenv [ENV_NAME] – creates and activates a fresh virtual environment
    workon [ENV_NAME] – activates an already-created virtual environment
    deactivate – deactivates the virtual environment that is currently active
    within an activated virtualenv, pip install [PACKAGE_NAME] installs a package into the virtualenv
    within an activated virtualenv, pip freeze lists the packages that is installed & accessible within the virtualenv
